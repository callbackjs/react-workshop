## Installing the workshop dependencies

To ensure that you're ready for the workshop, please make sure that you have Python installed on your system.

## Installing Python

The Python community has installers for many flavors of operating systems, including Windows and OSX. You can find the binaries here: `https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/`. For a more robust installation guide, navigate to the following URL: `https://goo.gl/qivCuh`. If you are running Windows, the Python binaries are **not** automatically added to your PATH environmental variable. Please ensure that you read the guide carefully to determine how you can add it to your environment.

## Downloading the workshop assets

You can download the workshop assets by pressing the "Download Zip" at the top-right of this repository page. Navigate to your project root directory. Execute `python server.py` and navigate to `localhost:8000` in Chrome or Firefox. If you see a blank page,Â you should be set.

## You're done!

You are all set for the workshop on March 8th at 8 PM. I'm looking forward to seeing you there! I'll also spend a few minutes during the workshop going over these steps, so feel free to skip any steps that are confusing. If you run into any issues/concerns, shoot an email to `vnair611@gmail.com`. I'd be more than happy to help debug your environment issues.
